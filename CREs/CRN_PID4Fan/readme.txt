This code solves the chemical reaction equations governing calcium ion, calcium indicator dynamics.

PIDmain.py    - produces the solution at node i, and can be ran from command line as
	        PIDmain.py i

processing.py - produces figures based off the output of PIDmain.py

driver.py     - executes PIDmain.py across all 18 nodes, removes the images generated by PIDmain.py (may or may not be shown)
	        then creates new plots based off the data.
