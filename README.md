# Turner-Evans Lab

Python Code developed for the Turner-Evans lab, starting Winter 2022. This repository was originally on gitlab, but migrated to github 2025, unfortunately removing some version history. 
This code contains many works, such as a numerical solution to a PDE which in theory provides neuronal firing rates as a function of angle and time within the head direction of Drosophila. 
Another project pertaining to calcium imaging was started here, and ultimately developed further into the slugFind pipeline.
